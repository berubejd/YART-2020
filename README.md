## Implementation of [Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)
---

This is my codebase for a Python3 and TCOD tutorial for creating a roguelike.  This edition of the tutorial was originally published for **The 4th annual summer code-along for RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial** which was held in 2020.

I was lucky enough to participate and *mostly* followed along in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) with some obvious differences.  That repo can be found [here](https://github.com/berubejd/RoguelikeDev-TCRT-v2020).
